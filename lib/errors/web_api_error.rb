# This error is raised when a Steam Web API request or a related action fails.

    # Creates a new `WebApiError` with an error message according to the given
    # `cause`. If this cause is `:status_bad` (which will origin from the Web API
    # itself) or `:http_error` the details about this failed request will be
    # taken from `status_code` and `status_message`.
    #
    # @param [:http_error, :invalid_key, :status_bad, :unauthorized] cause A
    #        symbolic name for the problem which caused this error:
    #
    #        * `:http_error`: An error during the HTTP request itself will result
    #           in an error with this reason.
    #        * `:invalid_key`: This occurs when trying to set a Web API key that
    #           isn't valid, i.e. a 128 bit integer in a hexadecimal string.
    #        * `:status_bad`: This is caused by a successful request that fails
    #          for some Web API internal reason (e.g. an invalid argument).
    #          Details about this failed request will be taken from `status_code`
    #          and `status_message`.
    #        * `:unauthorized`: This happens when a Steam Web API request is
    #          rejected as unauthorized. This most likely means that you did not
    #          specify a valid Web API key using {WebApi.api_key=}. A Web API key
    #          can be obtained from http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.
    #
    #        Other undefined reasons will cause a generic error message.
    # @param [Fixnum] status_code The HTTP status code returned by the Web API
    # @param [String] status_message The status message returned in the response
