  # Instead of filtering the results sent by the master server locally, you

  # by the master server.
  #
  # Available filters:
  #
  # * `\type\d`: Request only dedicated servers
  # * `\secure\1`: Request only secure servers
  # * `\gamedir\[mod]`: Request only servers of a specific mod
  # * `\map\[mapname]`: Request only servers running a specific map
  # * `\linux\1`: Request only linux servers
  # * `\emtpy\1`: Request only **non**-empty servers
  # * `\full\`: Request only servers **not** full
  # * `\proxy\1`: Request only spectator proxy servers
  #
  # @note Receiving all servers from the master server is taking quite some
  #       time.
