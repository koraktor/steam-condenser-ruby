module SteamCondenser::Servers::Packets

  # This packet class represents a A2M_GET_SERVERS_BATCH2 request sent to a
  # master server
  #
  # It is used to receive a list of game servers matching the specified
  # filters.
  #
  # Filtering:
  # Instead of filtering the results sent by the master server locally, you
  # should at least use the following filters to narrow down the results sent
  # by the master server. Receiving all servers from the master server is
  # taking quite some time.
  #
  # Available filters:
  #
  # * `\type\d`: Request only dedicated servers
  # * `\secure\1`: Request only secure servers
  # * `\gamedir\[mod]`: Request only servers of a specific mod
  # * `\map\[mapname]`: Request only servers running a specific map
  # * `\linux\1`: Request only linux servers
  # * `\emtpy\1`: Request only **non**-empty servers
  # * `\full\`: Request only servers **not** full
  # * `\proxy\1`: Request only spectator proxy servers
